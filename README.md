# Building-a-player-recommender-system-using-FIFA-23-dataset
The main idea of our project is to build a player recommender system based on the data from the FIFA 23 game.To keep it simple, when we enter a name of a player, the computer should spit out 3 other players with the most similar traits(not specifically based on their position, but mainly on their traits,skills and style). 

Please look at the "Breaking_down_the_nuiances_of_the_player_recommender_system" file to understand the components invovled and procedures used in building this system.
